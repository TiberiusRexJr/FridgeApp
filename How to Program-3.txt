How to Program-3

Problems
1.Overwhelmed, to much at once, reslults in only "GIST" being remember.
2. GIST =some syntax, CONCEPT
3. Devil is in the details, no details no machine.
4. Must test yourself [code yourself the project by hand; limited auto-complete]
5. ITS JUST a script.
6. 

SOLUTION
1. MINDSTATE [CONCPET WHAT AM I DOING]
2. BAKE A CAKE [SCRIPT, LINE BY LINE, A PLAY IN EACH FILE]
3. FORCE YOURSELF TO RECREATE [TEST, LINE BY LINE, JUST THIS]
4. CONTROL YOUR EXPECTATIONS. THIS IS THE WAY. LET SATISFACTION COME FROM MASTERY, NOT QUANTITY. I CAN DO <INSERT SKILL 
5. VISIBILE STRUCTURE TO THE CODE, ORDER TO HELP COMMIT TO ASSOCIATIONS, FLOW
6. API'S, RTFM, PARAMETERS, FUNCTIONS PURPOSES
7. WHAT I KNOW, WHAT I KNOW I DON'T KNOW, WHAT I FEEL, ITS OK TO BE WRONG; ITS NOT OK TO STAY STILL
8. Remember how you beat your own mind, body; anxiety through that nap. It's possible. Master yourself, your mind, body and 
	live from your soul.
9. Don't be afraid, strike, commit.
10. get into the ring from time to time, and just code. this is the true nature of programming, not just learning and practicing, to flow
11. know what datatypes your logic is returning, null is not ===0, remember. know what your NUGET library functions are actually doing, returning save yourself some time asshole
