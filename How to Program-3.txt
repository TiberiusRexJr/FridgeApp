How to Program-3

Problems
1.Overwhelmed, to much at once, reslults in only "GIST" being remember.
2. GIST =some syntax, CONCEPT
3. Devil is in the details, no details no machine.
4. Must test yourself [code yourself the project by hand; limited auto-complete]
5. ITS JUST a script.
6. 

SOLUTION
1. MINDSTATE [CONCPET WHAT AM I DOING]
2. BAKE A CAKE [SCRIPT, LINE BY LINE, A PLAY IN EACH FILE]
3. FORCE YOURSELF TO RECREATE [TEST, LINE BY LINE, JUST THIS]
4. CONTROL YOUR EXPECTATIONS. THIS IS THE WAY. LET SATISFACTION COME FROM MASTERY, NOT QUANTITY. I CAN DO <INSERT SKILL 
5. VISIBILE STRUCTURE TO THE CODE, ORDER TO HELP COMMIT TO ASSOCIATIONS, FLOW
6. API'S, RTFM, PARAMETERS, FUNCTIONS PURPOSES
7. WHAT I KNOW, WHAT I KNOW I DON'T KNOW, WHAT I FEEL, ITS OK TO BE WRONG; ITS NOT OK TO STAY STILL
8. Remember how you beat your own mind, body; anxiety through that nap. It's possible. Master yourself, you mind, body and 
	live from your soul.
